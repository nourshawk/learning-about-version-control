Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort but i can do it!

I like how version control enables me to easily track changes made to the project, so i can see what changes have been proposed and where. It is really useful for group prjects and effective team collaboration. 

However, it becomes difficult when multiple people are working on the same file and pushing edits in the same locations as it becomes hard to manage al potential merge conflicts and restore the file. Resolving these changes requires a lot attention, time and effort and can sometimes be tedious!
