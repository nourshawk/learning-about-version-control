# Learning About Version Control

Author: Nour Abdelfattah

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like that version control lets you track who changed what by providing a complete history of changes and commits. This allows us to collaborate on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work and gives the ability to revert back to old changes if errors are made/pushed.

The most frustrating thing about version control is resolving merge conflicts manually. When merge conflicts occur, especially with multiple collaborators, it becomes very tedious and time-consuming to manually edit and attempt to override conflicts and resume the workflow.
